    <string name="text3">How to make your environment safer
Avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are closed, crowded or involve close contact.
Outbreaks have been reported in restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices and places of worship where people have gathered, often in crowded indoor settings where they talk loudly, shout, breathe heavily or sing.
The risks of getting COVID-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected people spend long periods of time together in close proximity. These environments are where the virus appears to spread by respiratory droplets or aerosols more efficiently, so taking precautions is even more important.
Meet people outside. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones, particularly if indoor spaces are small and without outdoor air coming in.
For more information on how to hold events like family gatherings, children’s football games and family occasions, read our on small public gatherings.
Avoid crowded or indoor settings but if you can’t, then take precautions:
Open a window. Increase the amount of ‘natural ventilation’ when indoors.
WHO has published  on ventilation and air conditioning for both the general public and people who manage public spaces and buildings.
Wear a mask (see above for more details.
